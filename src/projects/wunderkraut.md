In an agile team of four I worked as a Drupal developer for Wunderkraut in Gothenburg. We worked mainly with larger size projects of Drupal distributions â€” and in the team I quickly advanced to being in charge of deployment. On every second fridays we had innovation-friday, thats when we had time to work on contrubuted Drupal modules and patches.

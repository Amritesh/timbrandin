Me and @silence150 (Josef Ottosson) worked together for inUse at Kungsportsplatsen in Gothenburg, with a tool for creating personas in the browser. In javascript we built a multi-line editor for SVG and a drag-n-drop tool for creating personas, that could be exported to AI, EPS or PDF for print â€” as the demand in our user studies was very high for printing and putting up on the wall.

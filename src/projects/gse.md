At the Airport on weekends I was responsible for directing aircrafts into the gate or to the stand, loading, unloading and sorting all luggage and freight. In the winter time I have also worked with snow plowing on all sorts of vehicles. During the summers of 06 and 07 I worked nights maintaining the 200 hectareas of grass surrounding the landing strip.

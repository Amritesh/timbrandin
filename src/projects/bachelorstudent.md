Studying Computer Science at Chalmers was a great experience as the courses spanned so many different areas, which steered my in the path that I am right now. To mention a few courses, I learned about control theory, data structures, databases, collage grade mathematics, algorithms and managing efficiency as well as parallelism in code. I would highly recommend the masters program at Chalmers, in beautiful Gothenburg, Sweden.

resumeteor
==========

A LinkedIn Resumé built with Meteor.

## Getting started

### Install meteor
    curl https://install.meteor.com | sh

### Setting up the repository
    git clone git@github.com:timbrandin/resumeteor YOURNAME
    cd YOURNAME

### We use Bower (http://bower.io) for package managing for dependecies in this project, so we need to install bower globally first.
    (sudo) npm install -g bower

### Then download and install all dependencies with bower.
    bower install

### Get running locally.
    meteor

### When ready, get running in the cloud (complements to the Meteor guys)
    meteor deploy YOURNAME.meteor.com

When you're ready to use a much cooler url like: http://timbrandin.com or something, check out meteor's documentation.
Otherwise I can help setting up your Resumé on Heroku, with your custom URL and stuff.
